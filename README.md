- readcreddata_sbe37_temp.m: Helper function for reading in data from NOAA CRED SBE37s.
- readsbedata_salt_interp.m: Helper function for reading in salinity data from 2014-16 deployment SBE37s.
- readaqddata_temp.m: Helper function for reading in temperature data from 2014-16 deployment Aquadopps.

_Plotting in situ observational and gridded data products_:

_Coral mini-core data I/O and calculation of SST contribution to coral d18O_:

- minicore_d18osw.m: plots mini-core coral d18O records along with bottle samples of salinity and seawater d18O. Used in main-text Figure 1b
- sstcontr_palmyra_elninoevts.m: calculates the contribution of SST to coral d18O using atoll-mean in situ temperature and Palmyra mini-core coral d18O. Used in main-text Table 1.

_isoROMS assimilation analyses_:

- enanomcomp_romsassim.m: Calculates composite anomalies in isoROMS assimilation fields. Used in main-text Figure 2.
- calc_anomd18oswbudget_assim.m: Helper function which does the computation of the Reynolds-decomposed budget of seawater d18O.
